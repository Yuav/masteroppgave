\section{Introduction}

Solar cells is an important renewable energy source. Solar energy has the potential to solve challenges related to renewable energy with regards to climate issues. A prognoses done by Bundesverband Solarwirthschaft for German solar industry, suggest that solar energy will dominate the energy section 100 years from now. For this to happend, larger production volumes, and better utilization of the sunlight is needed. Photovoltaic solar cells generating electricity, are dominated by multicrystalline silicon fabrication. This gives cost efficient solar cells, but at a low efficiency. This means there is a large potential for increased efficiency. In order to increase efficiency, it is important to understand how a solar cell works, and how to be able to characterize solar cell materials.

This thesis is concentrating on silicon characterization based on micro photoluminescence at low temperatures. By illuminating a sample of multicrystalline silicon, it is possible to extract information about the sample, like defects and impurity, based on the returning light. Even small concentrations of impurities will influence the properties of silicon material, and hence the solar cell. 

An overview of previous studies characterizing relevant spectra for silicon is needed, as well as an understanding of how photoluminescence can be used to detect and characterize different defects and impurities. 

Three different samples has been chosen. One clean sample with few impurities, and two samples from a compensated feedstock, where on of them has additional chromium added. These samples are from wafers produced, and used, by the photovoltaic industry (the compensated feedstock samples are from Elkem), and consist of multicrystalline silicon. The goal is to characterize these three samples by the use of low temperature micro photoluminescence.
