\section{Results}

Results have been corrected for dead pixels, dark current, and background noise where background noise measurements have been available. Grating is fixed at 300, and pumping wavelength is 800nm.

\subsection{R6-Q3-201}

This is the electronic grade sample, with a very low amount of impurities.
