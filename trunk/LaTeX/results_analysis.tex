The strong TO line and its replicas, has relative intensities similar to those found in \cite{dean67}. Low impurity levels  in the sample allows for comparisons with intrinsic characteristics from \cite{dean67} (figure \ref{fig:SiPL}). Comparison show TO + 2 Zone center phonon at 0.968~eV, TO + Zone center phonon at 1.0315~eV, intervalley phonon replicas around 1.07~eV, TO at 1.097~eV and TA at 1.365~eV. It is also possible that the peak at 1.54~eV is the ideally forbidden no phonon peak, but it is very close to the noise floor, and cannot be unequivocally identified. The intensity differences can be due to small differences in focus of the excitation light, or other small alignment changes when physically moving the sample.


TO + Zone center phonon line have 7~\% relative intensity to TO in \cite{dean67}, when pumped with 7~W from a mercury arc on to an etched surface of intrinsic silicon. The relative intensity of TO + Zone center phonon line is \~6~\% for both the dislocation line, and dislocation dot. The difference here could be due to a bound exciton line at 1.092~eV also influencing the TO line. This peak at 1.092~eV is attributed to the TO phonon assisted Si:B bound excitons \cite{sauer73}. The Si:B free exciton would be at 1.150~eV, with 10\% intensity relative to the TO. This line could be present by judgning the R6 results, however due to the noise level, it is hard to know for sure, but the relative intensities would be in the same order of magnitude as in \cite{sauer73} if it is in fact the free exciton line.


Lines not present in intrinsic, silicon in addition to bound excitons, are one around 1~eV, and the increased intensity of TO + 2 zone center phonons which is expected to be ~1~\% of the TO line \cite{dean67}, which appear to be \~7~\% in the R6 dislocation line , and \~3~\% in the R6 dislocation dot. These are likely to originate from dislocations. D3 and D4 are known to appear at 0.934~eV and 1.00~eV respectively at 4.2~K in CZ-Si \cite{drozdov76}. D4 has not been observed without D3, and vice versa, and D3 is considered to be a phonon replica of D4 \cite{kveder95}. In addition, \cite{tajima95} report a broad background emission reaching from 0.9-1.0~eV with D3 and D4 present. In the R6 results, on the dislocation dot, there's signs of D3' and D4' lines at 0.95~eV, and 1.0~eV respectively. This corresponds to measurements on mc-Si with a temperature of 77K, from \cite{tarasov00}, which reports a shift in the energies when comparing CZ-Si and mc-Si. The D3 line is larger than D4, which can be explained by the small energy differences between the three, momentum conserving TO phonons, which cause three replicas slightly different in the their energy \cite{arguirov07}.

If, in fact, it is the D3 and D4 lines in the result, D1 and D2, which also are attributed to dislocation areas are completely missing. \cite{kitler02} state that a relatively low contamination level of dislocations in the order of 10 impurity atoms/mm of the dislocation length produces D1 defect luminescence at room temperature. \cite{arguirov07} state that D1 and D2 are most probably caused by the interaction of the dislocations with background metallic impurities. This is a probable reason, due to the low level of such impurities in R6.
