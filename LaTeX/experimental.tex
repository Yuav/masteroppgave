\section{Experimental}

Focus areas: Contaminants from Chromium, Titanium, Iron.



4 Samples: All polished and etched on top

Chromium contaminated, less than 10^13 cm^-3

Boron and Phosphorus equally distributed around 10^16 cm^-3.

Regular MC solar grade sample

Pure Si sample (FZ?)


\subsection{Spot size}

At some distinct spots of a size between 1µm and 4µm the band to band photoluminescence peak is particular low at spots with iron precipitates  \cite{gundel09}.



\subsection{Pumping wavelength}

Absorption length of about 1µm for 532 nm laser, means that iron precipitates deeper in the sample won't be detected \cite{gundel09}. This limitation might be overcome by an excitation laser with a longer wavelength and absorption length in silicon.
