\section{Results}

Results have been corrected for dead pixels, measured dark current, and measured background. Grating is fixed at 300, and pumping wavelength is 800nm. Counts is a number given from the spectrometer which relate to the relative intensity detected by the pixel in the CCD. The excitation laser intensity is the intensity hitting the sample. This intensity is measured before the objective, and calculated using the objective data sheet. Defect dot is a description used about the black dots in the microscope pictures, which can be related to dislocations, etch pits, or other defects in the crystal.
